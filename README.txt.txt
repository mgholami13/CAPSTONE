This project folder contains the following directories:

1. **Data**: This directory contains the dataset used for the analysis. The dataset includes historical Forex market data obtained from Kaggle and Yahoo Finance.

2. **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks that document the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling processes:
	1. Capstone_EDA.ipynb
	2. Capstone_Regression_SARIMA.ipynb
	3. Capstone_Regression_ML.ipynb
	
3. **Report**: This directory contains the final project report, summarizing the key findings, insights, and results. The report includes a high-level overview of the problem statement, data description, cleaning and preprocessing steps, EDA, modeling approaches (such as univariate and multivariate SARIMA time series analysis, neural networks, and LSTM networks), model evaluation metrics, and visualizations of the results. The report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the project and its outcomes.

4. **Environments**: This directory contains the environments required for the notebooks:
	1. timeseries: Required for "Capstone_Regression_SARIMA.ipynb"
	2. deeplearning: Required for "Capstone_Regression_ML.ipynb"
